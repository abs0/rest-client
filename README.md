# WizTools.org RESTClient

## About

This is a fork of the abandoned WizTools.org RESTClient, with gradle config and dependencies updated to allow running under java 17.

Building of mac specific binaries has been commented out pending macAppBundle support for Gradle >=7.

It is built to target Java 8 or later.

RESTClient is a Java application to test RESTful webservices. It can be used to test variety of HTTP communications. There are two executables:

* GUI version (restclient-ui-X.jar download)
* Cli version for batch execution of .rcq files (restclient-cli-X.jar download)

### Since 2007

The first version of RESTClient was released late 2007. Visit [project news page](https://github.com/wiztools/rest-client/wiki/News) for history of releases.
